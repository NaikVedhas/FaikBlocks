## 📝Description

- In today's fast-changing technological world, fake products are a big problem. They're not just about losing money; they can also be dangerous and hurt a brand's reputation. To address  this issue , we use a smart system that uses blockchain tech to spot fake product.
- Blockchain, known for its decentralized and immutable nature, provides a robust platform for tracking and verifying the authenticity of products throughout their lifecycle.
- This system developed here provides a platform for verifying the Originality of the product.

## 🔮Future Scope


-  COMPANYS CAN REGISTRATION IN THEIR OWN CURRENCY: It will be possible to Use currency depending on the country. There wont be any compulsion to use standard currencies only.
-  While registering, we will take 5% of the product's cost as fee for using our platform. 

## 💸MONETISATION: 

1. A total of 5% is taken from the products cost. This is will be a part of the registration and usage fee. No separate fees will later be taken.
2. Advertisement

## 🛠Project Setup

- STEP 1: Install Node.js and npm: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications in JavaScript and run them on the server. It includes a rich library of modules, known as npm (Node Package Manager), that enables developers to add functionality to their applications quickly and easily. It is widely used for web application development, building networked applications, and developing server-side scripts.
- STEP 2: Install Metamask Extension MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that provides an interface for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store, manage, and send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens, as well as interact with dApps in a user-friendly way.
- STEP 3: Configure a Metamask Account
- STEP 4: Navigate to the repository and clone it: Clone our GitHub Respository
